This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: fixed-size table overflow. The `bug.cob` file contains code that causes this error, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a solution. The error occurs when attempting to store more entries into a table than it was originally allocated.  The solution uses dynamic memory allocation to prevent the overflow.  This example highlights the importance of careful data structure selection when developing COBOL applications.
