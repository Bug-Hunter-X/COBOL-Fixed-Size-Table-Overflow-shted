* In this code, the table WS-TABLE is declared with a fixed size of 100 entries. 
* If the program attempts to store more than 100 entries, it will result in a storage violation or unpredictable behavior. 
* This is a common error in COBOL programs, where the programmer doesn't anticipate the potential growth of the data.  
* A dynamic array or linked list might be a better choice for situations with variable data size.
